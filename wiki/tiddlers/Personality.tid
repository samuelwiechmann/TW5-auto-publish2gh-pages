[[Personality|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality]] is defined as the characteristic set of behaviors, cognitions, and emotional patterns that evolve from biological and environmental factors.[1] While there is no generally agreed upon definition of personality, most theories focus on motivation and psychological interactions with one's environment.
