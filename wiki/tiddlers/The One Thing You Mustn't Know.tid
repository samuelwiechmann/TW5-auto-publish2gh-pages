Human consciousness at the same time as it is a form of awareness, sensitivity, and understanding, it's also a form of ignorance. The ordinary everyday concsiousness that we have leaves out more than it takes in. And because of this it leaves out things that are terribly important. It leaves out things that would if we did know them allay our anxieties, fears and horrors. And if we could extend our awareness to include the things that we leave out, we would have a deep interior peace. Because we would all know ''the one thing you mustn't know''. One thing you mustn't know, according to the rules of our particular social game. One thing you mustn't know, that's the lowdown on life. [...]
