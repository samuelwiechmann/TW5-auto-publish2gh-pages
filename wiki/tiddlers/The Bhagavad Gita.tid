John Gorman:
"[...] quite honestly, is the single greatest, purest, most beautiful manifesto on how to live a complete, compassionate, empathetic life I’ve ever read. It’s one of the holiest of holy texts in the world and — even if you don’t believe in god (I don’t) — is as endlessly re-readable as it is profound.

It explores the nature of god, life, earth and the self. It outlines knowledge, devotion, action and meditation as noble, spiritual pursuits. It’s a call to action, a post-graduate course in how to treat other humans, and it’s the skeleton key to peace, love and understanding."
