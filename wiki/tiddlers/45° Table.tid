This table is the result of my work in the course revolving around the topic of "Sorge" (care, worry). 

I worried about school education and tried to solve the problem of furniture flexibility.

You want to be able to use varying configurations and to put all tables away when you don't need them.

So they should be easily stackable and combine into all sorts of different shapes.

More on the concept on demand.
