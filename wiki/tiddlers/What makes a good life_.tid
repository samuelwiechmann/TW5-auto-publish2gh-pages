''2015 | Robert Waldinger | TED | 13 min''
What keeps us happy and healthy as we go through life? If you think it's fame and money, you're not alone â€“ but, according to psychiatrist Robert Waldinger, you're mistaken. As the director of a 75-year-old study on adult development, Waldinger has unprecedented access to data on true happiness and satisfaction. In this talk, he shares three important lessons learned from the study as well as some practical, old-as-the-hills wisdom on how to build a fulfilling, long life.
