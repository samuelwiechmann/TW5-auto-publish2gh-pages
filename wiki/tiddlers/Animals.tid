<<image-left "animals.PNG">>Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the [[Blastula]], during [[Embryonic Development]]. 

Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million in total. 

Animals range in size from 8.5 millionths of a metre to 33.6 metres (110 ft) long and have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The study of animals is called [[Zoology]].
