Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, literature is writing considered to be an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage.

Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction, and whether it is poetry or prose.
