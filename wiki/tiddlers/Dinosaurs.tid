<<image-left "dinousaurs.PNG">>Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria. The fossil record indicates that [[Birds]] are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the late Jurassic Period. As such, birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago.
