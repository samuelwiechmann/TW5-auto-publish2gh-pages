MacCready, a noted American aeronautics engineer, designer, and world soaring champion. Gossamer Albatross was his second human-powered aircraft, the first being the Gossamer Condor , which had won the first Kremer prize on August 23, 1977, by completing a 1-mile (1.6 km)-long figure-eight course.</p></blockquote>
