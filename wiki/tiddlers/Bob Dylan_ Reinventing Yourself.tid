"""[[Bob Dylan: Reinventing Yourself|https://www.designluck.com/bob-dylan/]]
''Rat Zana | 2018 | designluck | article''

"Life is long and messy, and it demands that we change to accommodate it as time goes on. In this piece, I have used Bob Dylan as an example of someone who has successfully adapted himself in a healthy way over a long career. It's about effectively dealing with growth and a changing self."
