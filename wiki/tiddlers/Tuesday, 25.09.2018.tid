I decided to just start driving to the West, until I reach the river Rhein.

I discovered the KÃ¼hkopf-Knoblochsaue which is a beautifully quiet and wide space.

Coming back in the darkness I took a ride back into the city in the slipstream of a bus. It was wonderfully warm and relaxed.
Then I visited Clara, got some niice food and conversation.
Beautiful day.
