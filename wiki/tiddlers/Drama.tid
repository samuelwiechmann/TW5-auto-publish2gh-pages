Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's Poetics (c. 335 BC)â€”the earliest work of dramatic theory. 
In literature, the word drama defines a genre, or style of writing. Drama is a play that can be performed for theatre, radio or even television.
